Q&A
---

**Q:** There is already a [Dictionaries package](https://github.com/SublimeText/Dictionaries "Dictionaries package") for Sublime Text, why another ?

**A:** Dictionaries is a really good package, but is too big to download.

**Q:** Other languages?

**A:** You are free to clone this repo from the Github user superbob, provide any language you wish and add your package to Sublime Package Control.

**Q:** Can I contribute?

**A:** If you want to add a newer version of the Portuguese dictionaries (pt_BR) you can submit a pull request. But I hope that I will be able to keep it up-to-date by myself.

**Q:** Whys is this text written in Portuguese?

**A:** Even if portuguese is my first language, I consider this page a little bit technical and I prefer to write technical stuff in English. Moreover I consider that people who want to add packages to Sublime Text are used to read in English.
